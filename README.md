# gint

gint (g = *Giant*) brings wide integers to C++11 with a lightweight, performance-first design. It is **header-only** for frictionless adoption, and guarantees **bit-accurate** semantics: the width you declare (e.g., 128/256/512â€¦) is exactly the width you get at runtime.

Co-maintained by me and **OpenAI Codex** â€” with a little inspiration from a hippo ðŸ¦›.

**Highlights**

* **C++11 compatible** across diverse toolchains.
* **Header-only** for painless integration.
* **High performance** by design.
* **Bit-accurate width** strictly matching the definition.

## Performance

Benchmarks on a 2.8Â GHz CPU compare the C++11 implementation of
`gint::integer<256>` against Boost.Multiprecision's `int256_t`. Timings
are in nanoseconds (lower is better).

| Operation (mixed operands) | `gint` | Boost.Multiprecision |
| ------------------------- | -------------: | -------------------: |
| Addition                  |        3.70 ns |             10.4 ns |
| Subtraction               |        4.57 ns |             25.4 ns |
| Multiplication            |        9.42 ns |             22.3 ns |
| Division                  |        21.0 ns |              161 ns |


## Quick Start

```cpp
#include <gint/gint.h>

int main() {
    gint::integer<256, unsigned> a = 1;
    gint::integer<256, unsigned> b = 2;
    auto c = (a << 128) + b;
    auto low = static_cast<std::uint64_t>(c);
    // ...
}
```

## Edge-Case Semantics

Let **W** denote the bit width of the type.

- **Constructing an unsigned wide integer from a negative value**  
  The result is congruent to the source **mod \(2^W\)** (same as C++ integral conversion to unsigned).  
  *Example:* `u256 x = -1;  // x == 2^256 - 1`

- **Unsigned arithmetic wraparound (including subtraction underflow)**  
  Results are computed **mod \(2^W\)**, matching built-in unsigned types.  
  *Example:* `u256(0) - u256(1) == 2^256 - 1`.

- **Bitwise operations on negative values**  
  Signed wide integers use **twoâ€™s-complement** representation; bitwise operators (`~ & ^ |`) act on that bit pattern.  
  Shifts are defined explicitly:  
  - signed `>>` is **arithmetic** (sign-propagating)  
  - unsigned `>>` is **logical** (zero-fill)

- **Division / modulo by zero**  
  Controlled by the compile-time macro **`GINT_ENABLE_DIVZERO_CHECKS`**:
  - **Default (macro *not* defined)**: **no check**; behavior is **undefined** (UB), just like built-ins.
  - **Checks enabled (`#define GINT_ENABLE_DIVZERO_CHECKS 1` before including `gint`)**: division or modulo by zero **throws `std::domain_error`**.


## Building Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Building Benchmarks

```bash
make bench
```

## Code Coverage

To generate a coverage report locally:

```bash
make coverage
```

This builds the project with coverage flags, runs the tests, and
produces a coverage report under the `build-coverage` directory.
